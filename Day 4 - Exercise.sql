/*Day 4 Assignment: DML – Insert, Update, Delete
Use a backup or copy of hr.employees (e.g-- Hr_emp_backup) for DML so you do not change production data. If needed, create it with CREATE TABLE hr_emp_backup AS SELECT * FROM hr.employees WHERE 1=0; plus required columns, or use your Day 3 table.
Part 1: Practice Questions (With Answers and Explanations)*/

CREATE TABLE hr_emp_backup AS
SELECT * FROM hr.employees where 1=0;

/* Question 1
Insert one row into your backup table. Use a new employee_id (e.g. 999), set first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, job_id, salary, department_id to valid values.
Answer:*/

INSERT INTO hr_emp_backup (employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, job_id, salary, department_id)
VALUES (999, 'John', 'Doe', 'JDOE', SYSDATE, 'SA_REP', 5000, 50);

/* Question 2
Update salary by 10% for all employees in department_id 60 in your backup table.
Answer:*/

UPDATE hr_emp_backup
SET salary = salary * 1.10
WHERE department_id = 60;

/* Question 3
Delete all rows from your backup table where department_id is NULL.

--Part 2: Self-Practice (No Answers)

--1. Bulk insert into your backup table from hr.employees only for employees whose salary is greater than 10000.

insert into hr_emp_backup (employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, job_id, salary, department_id) 
select employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, job_id, salary, department_id
from hr.employees 
where salary > 10000; 

--2. Update job_id for a specific employee_id in your backup table (choose an id and a valid job_id).

update  hr_emp_backup set job_id = 'NA' where employee_id = 999; 

--3. Delete rows from your backup table that you inserted for testing (e.g. where employee_id = 999).

delete from hr_emp_backup where employee_id = 999;
